    <h4>Head Instructor</h4>
    <h4><%= link_to "Ruby on Rails", "/rubyonrails.html" %> and <%= link_to "Front End Development", "/frontend.html" %> Instructor</h4>

    <p>Al Zimmerman has 30 years of experience in software design, product development, information technology, and management. He has been teaching various aspects of software engineering and programming for over a dozen years to middle school students, college students, and professional engineers. He has experienced the joys of being on a tight-knit team of collaborators and wants to share that experience with his students.</p>

    <p>He is currently on a mission to increase diversity in the programming profession, having experienced the thrill of product development on teams composed of men, women, artists, engineers and scientists. "The best ideas come from all directions at once," he says.</p>

    <p>"More than anything," he says, "I love being in a classroom with talented, inquisitive people, helping them discover new things and achieve their career goals."</p>

    <p>In his spare time, Al is an improvisational comedy actor at Curious Comedy Theater where he finds that listening carefully, responding honestly, and laughing frequently is as useful on stage as it is in the classroom.</p>

    <h4><%= link_to "JavaScript Immersion", "/javascriptimmersion.html" %> Instructor</h4>
    <p>
      Whitney Young has been a software developer and instructor for over 10 years. Before joining Portland Code School, he co-founded a software company in Chicago which focused on creating simple, intuitive, and useful Mac and iOS applications. During this time, he trained and built a strong team of engineers, re-discovering his passion for teaching. He is also responsible for creating a computer security course at his alma mater, where he honed his curriculum development and teaching skills. Throughout his career, Whitney has spoken at numerous technical conferences, served as a mentor for up-and-coming developers, and volunteered his time to teach programming to beginners. He has worked on complex back-end web architectures, highly custom native mobile apps, and everything in between.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whitney has two strong beliefs about learning to code. First, and most important, is that anyone can learn to be a great developer. All that's required is a healthy dose of passion and the desire to tackle challenging problems. Second, coding is about clear communication with <i>other people</i>. The best software developers are able to clearly express their intent verbally, through writing, and through code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recently, Whitney has been learning Spanish and snowboarding. He's constantly humbled when listening to people switch flawlessly between languages or watching fearless young kids out on the slopes.

    <h3 id="andrew-lorente" class="link-padding">Andrew Lorente</h3>
    <h4><%= link_to "JavaScript Immersion", "/javascriptimmersion.html" %> Instructor</h4>
    <p>
      Andrew Lorente has been writing software professionally for most of a decade, in just about every role a web developer can have: frontend to backend, database optimization to CSS styling. Unwilling to wait for an actual teaching job to share his love of programming, Andrew started serving as a mentor with Code Scouts in mid-2013. He's thrilled to be expanding into a formal classroom environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he's away from the computer, Andrew enjoys bicycling, woodworking, and cats.

    <h4><%= link_to "Full-Stack JavaScript", "/javascript.html" %> Instructor</h4>
    <p>
      Dan has arrived in web development after a long path of software development shenanigans winding through natural language processing, multiscale graphical interfaces, and digital ethnography. He has some sort of degree in trying to understand the cognitive consequences of interface design. He likes carpentry as much as programming and finds many parallels between them, including the judicious use of hammers. He hopes the computers remember that next time they do what he actually says instead of what he means.

    <h4><%= link_to "Full-Stack JavaScript", "/javascript.html" %> Instructor</h4>
    <p>
      Benjamin Preston Verble does freelance, front-end web development when he's not teaching developers.  He continues to be pleasantly surprised by how engaging and fun coding is. His classroom style helps him to be relatable to beginners while his experience helps him challenge more advanced students. He has lived in Portland for seven years and loves it. His hobbies are guitar, disc golf, and coffee roasting. He is husband to a beautiful, intelligent wife and father to a hilarious, cute, and loud little boy.

    <h4>Data Visualization Instructor</h4>
    <p>
      Huston Hedinger is the Founder and CEO of GraphAlchemist, a Portland based firm that provides data science and data visualization as a service.  Huston loves data visualization, and the amazingly complex stories that data viz elegantly tells.  He began his software engineering journey in R and Python while in graduate school.  Now Huston works across all web technologies with his team, with a focus on d3.js for data visualization, angular.js as a client side web framework, and neo4j the worlds leading graph database and a cutting edge NoSQL technology.

    <p>
      Clarissa is a graduate student at Portland State hoping to get her PhD in Computer Science sometime before the heat-death of the Universe. She enjoys teaching, mathematics, and writing painfully weird poetry. She's a logician at heart hoping to secretly indoctrinate all programmers she meets into seeing themselves as constructive mathematicians, but would settle for getting to share a few cute facts about computability and intuitionist logic now and again.

    <h3>Shawna Scott</h3>
    <h4>Digital Content Manager</h4>
    <p>
      Shawna is a graduate of Portland Code School's Ruby on Rails class. Her background is in education, activist organizing, and fine arts. Looking for community, Shawna began attending and then co-organizing Women Who Hack, a local user group for women in tech, at the urging of a friend. Even though she never thought of herself as technically inclined, she discovered that coding was not only fascinating, it could provide a career that would utilize both her critical thinking skills and creativity!
    </p>
    <p>
      When she's not coding or attending tech user groups, Shawna loves to spend time reading, throwing pottery, or relaxing with her wonderful wife, Tina, and their two furbabies, Mia the dog, and Quade the cat.
